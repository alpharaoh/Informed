## What is INFORMED?

INFORMED is a work in progress full-stack project which gives a faster, alternative solution to twitch notifications and it's player. Under the hood, the current website for twitch uses an extreme amount of computing power and constantly sends a buckload of requests to external sources. This causes many complaints about Twitch accessability and usability as users with low end hardware often have a lot of buffering on the player and slowness, especially when doing other tasks. INFORMED is here to provide a clean, ultra-fast user interface for the twitch site and viewing content through Twitch.tv

Moreover, A problem that I personally was facing was with Twitch's super slow notifications for when streamers go live. I often see a notification after the streamer has been live for over 10-20 minutes! This was a huge issue that I wanted to fix. Strangely, the Twitch API is actually not so slow and shows that the streamer is live after around 5 seconds. At informed, if you sign up with us you will be able to get these instant notifications so you don't miss anything!

Finally, the most significant feature how informed interacts with mobile. There is currently a huge problem with Twitch's app where the stream is about 10 seconds behind the chat. This makes it unwatchable for most people where the chat is a huge part of the stream. INFORMED fixes this delay but also ads more features when viewing content such as scaling the chat to make it smaller for more video estate and other features!

## To do:

 - I have already built a scalable faster implementation of twitch notifications in python which can be transfered to Java.
 - Finish the home page. 
 - Add mobile/tablet video player scaling
